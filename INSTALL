Linux or Unix-like:

  To compile clc-laby, you need ocaml >= 4.10.0, lablgtk3 >= 3.1.0 and
  lablgtk3-sourceview3 >= 3.1.0).

  Execute the following commands in the archive's main directory:

    make
    ln -s ${PWD}/data ${HOME}/.config/laby

  If you want the program to produce some kind of absurd sounds, make
  sure the alsa "aplay" command is present on your system.

  Now to run clc-laby type:

    ./clc-laby


Windows:
  clc-laby doesnt officially support windows. the text below remains from
  when this project was forked from laby. 


  The best advice is to use pre-compiled binaries available on the web:
    http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/users/sgimenez/data/fdls/windows/
  Those binaries are cross-compiled using mingw-ocaml.
  If you plan to compile them by yourself on windows, you will
  probably need patience and a lot of good luck and the following
  software:

    - ocaml: http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
    - lablgtk: http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
    - gtksourceview: http://projects.gnome.org/gtksourceview/download.html
